### 2026-01-22: Go binary not in PATH

**Problem:** `go test` failed with "command not found"

**Solution:** Use full path `/home/trevor/go/bin/go`

**Lesson:** Always check if tools are in PATH. Document full paths in AGENTS.md.

### 2026-01-22: Documentation without implementation

**Problem:** Task 23 created BROWSER_TESTING.md documenting `npm run test:e2e`, but:
- Playwright was never installed
- No e2e/ directory created
- No test:e2e script in package.json

The task's `done_when` was "BROWSER_TESTING.md exists" which allowed this gap.

**Solution:** Added Task 25 to actually implement the E2E test setup.

**Lesson:** Documentation tasks require verification. Run every command you document.
If `done_when` only requires docs to exist, you still must verify the docs work.

### 2026-01-22: Memory files were not updated

**Problem:** After 24 tasks, LEARNINGS.md was empty and no new specs were created in `specs/*.md`.
Ralph read RALPH.md but treated memory updates as optional.

**Solution:** Updated RALPH.md to make LEARNINGS.md mandatory and clarify that specs
should be created for new features.

**Lesson:** Explicit is better than implicit. If a step is important, make it a rule,
not a suggestion.

### 2026-01-22: Meta - How to evaluate and improve Ralph

**Context:** A human reviewed Ralph's work after 24 tasks and found systemic gaps:
empty LEARNINGS.md, unimplemented documentation, spec TODOs ignored, implementation
deviating from spec (whisper-cli vs whisper-server).

**Process used:**
1. Read RALPH.md to understand expected behavior
2. Check git history to see what was actually done
3. Analyze logs (`grep -v "=== Iteration" /tmp/ralph_logs | jq ...`) to understand decisions
4. Compare specs/docs against actual implementation
5. File tasks for every gap found
6. Update RALPH.md to prevent future mistakes but keept it short! RALPH.md and AGENTS.md get loaded
   on every subagent, so they must be token efficient with LLM inference.
7. Seed LEARNINGS.md with examples so Ralph knows what entries look like

**Lesson:** Ralph should periodically do this self-review:
- Are the specs up to date? Are TODOs getting filled in?
- Does the implementation match the spec? If not, is the spec wrong or the code?
- What did I learn that future Ralphs need to know?
- Am I just completing tasks, or am I improving the system?

Ralph isn't just a task executor - Ralph should be self-improving. File tasks to fix
gaps. Update specs when requirements change. Keep LEARNINGS.md current. The goal is
that each Ralph iteration leaves the project in a better state than it found it.
