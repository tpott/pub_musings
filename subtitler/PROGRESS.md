  - Basic home page with project branding
  - Upload page with drag-and-drop video upload UI
  - Proxy configured to forward `/api/*` to backend
  - Runs on http://localhost:4321

- **Backend (Go)**: Located in `backend/`
  - Basic HTTP server with health check endpoint (`/api/health`)
  - Placeholder upload endpoint (`/api/upload`)
  - Runs on http://localhost:8080

### Task 2: Backend - Accept video file uploads

**Date**: 2026-01-21

Implemented video file upload handling in `backend/main.go`:

- Validates content type is `video/*`
- Enforces 500 MB max file size
- Generates unique upload ID using crypto/rand
- Saves files to `backend/uploads/` directory
- Returns JSON response with `upload_id`, `filename`, `size`

### Task 3: Frontend - Complete upload flow

**Date**: 2026-01-21

Updated `frontend/src/pages/upload.astro` to:

- Actually send video files to backend `/api/upload`
- Show real-time upload progress with progress bar
- Display success/error states with appropriate styling
- Prevent duplicate uploads while one is in progress
- Validate file size on client side (500 MB limit)
