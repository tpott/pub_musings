# Status

This file tracks high level progress on the peekaboo project.

## Current State

Production-ready voice-controlled web app for children. 138 tasks completed.

### Architecture
- **Go backend** with SQLite, WebSocket audio streaming, age encryption
- **Astro frontend** with TypeScript, 239+ unit tests, 19+ E2E tests
- **External services**: whisper-server (STT), Anthropic/OpenAI (intent), optional Piper (TTS)

### Key Features
- Full voice flow: record → transcribe → intent → media display
- WebSocket streaming (default) with continuous listening mode
- Day/night theme (light/dark/auto) with warm neutral palette
- Feedback form with database persistence and rate limiting
- Piper TTS integration (optional)
- Accessibility: ARIA labels, skip-to-content, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- Security: CSP headers, path traversal defense, URL validation, rate limiting, CORS
- Structured logging, health probes, graceful shutdown

### Documentation
- docs/API.md, docs/DEPLOY.md, docs/SECURITY.md, docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md, docs/PERFORMANCE.md
- specs/ directory with architecture, WebSocket protocol, continuous listening, feedback, Piper TTS, Bazel research

### Quality
- Linting: gofmt, go vet, golangci-lint, npm build, filesize lint (scripts/lint.sh)
- Pre-commit hook runs lint + tests for changed projects
- Test organization: files split to stay under 500 lines

## Last Completed

- Task 138 (2026-02-06): Phase 1b — Parse full whisper verbose_json response
  - Added `Words`, `Tokens`, `Temperature`, `AvgLogProb`, `NoSpeechProb` to `WhisperSegment`
  - Added `WhisperWord` struct (word, start, end, probability)
  - `transcribeAudio` and `forwardToWhisper` now return `*WhisperResponse` (not just text)
  - WebSocket sends rich transcript with segments + word-level data
  - HTTP `/api/transcribe` response includes segments with word data
  - Added `split_on_word=true` to whisper requests for cleaner word boundaries
  - TestWhisperResponseFullParse now passes (was intentionally-failing since task 136)
