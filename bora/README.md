# bora (बोरा)

A collection of backup related utilities. The basic idea is that you can use
simple FAT formatted USB as a backup, even if you have files greater than 4GB.
There are some small, primary functionalities

* Check what data exists in a current filesystem
* Check what data is currently backed up
* Restore all or parts of a backup
* Testing a backup should be easy

Note that this is a collection, so there is a mix of languages here. But in
order to make sure these tools are compatible, there are minimial dependencies.
